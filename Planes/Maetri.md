# Maetri

Maetri is the plane of existence that could be considered the home of the True Gods. While each of them has their own domain within it, Maetri could be described as the whole - ie while they each have a room, it exists on the property called Maetri. The area where the worlds are created is Eme's Garden. While worlds can be moved in and out of the garden they retain their link to the garden.
